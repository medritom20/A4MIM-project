This is a repository for a team project in the course **Algorithms of Matrix Iterative Methods** (taught by Stefano Pozza, Ph.D., Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University).

## Team
- **Siqing** – theory lead and presentation
- **Guilherme** – coding lead, implementation of `Algorithm 4 (HS-BCG)`
- **Kamil** – TBD (experiments / validation)
- **Tomas** – implementation of `Algorithm 8 (PDP-BCG)`
- **Jiri** – implementation of `Algorithm 7 (PDR-BCG)`

## Goal
Replicate and experiment with the methods from:

> P. Tichý, G. Meurant, D. Šimonová, **"Block CG algorithms revisited"**, *Numerical Algorithms*, 2025.  
> DOI: [10.1007/s11075-025-02038-4](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11075-025-02038-4) (OA under the CC BY 4.0 license)
